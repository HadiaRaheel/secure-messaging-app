# Attack Demonstrations

## How to Run

### 1. MITM Attack Demo
```bash
node mitm-attack.js
```

This demonstrates:
- How MITM attack works without digital signatures
- How signatures prevent MITM attacks

### 2. Replay Attack Demo
```bash
node replay-attack.js
```

This demonstrates:
- How replay attacks work
- How sequence numbers, nonces, and timestamps prevent replays

## For Project Report

Take screenshots of:
1. Running both attack scripts
2. The console output showing attacks
3. The protection mechanisms

Include these in your "Attack Demonstrations" section.
